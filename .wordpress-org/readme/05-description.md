### Scaling LifterLMS From A Simple Online Course

LifterLMS is incredibly flexible, customizable and scalable. It can be used for a simple one course website, and it can also be used as a course marketplace or multi instructor online school.

The plugin is lightweight enough to handle niche sites with low course enrollments, while also powering huge universities and employee training in Fortune 500 corporations. We've even worked with a site that has over 730,000 course enrollments.

Unlike hosted LMS software where you would pay increasing monthly fees for access and growth, LifterLMS does not charge you more per course. LifterLMS also does not charge you more per instructor or per student or based on your revenue.

Whether you are going big or keeping it small, LifterLMS scales to meet your needs for online courses, memberships, training portals, or remote schools.

### What Others Are Saying About LifterLMS

> _"I've used a number of course creation and delivery platforms over the years. And they were all fine… right up to the day when they weren't. The trouble is, they all want you to package and manage your course the way THEY think you should do it. THEIR feature set. THEIR way to do it. **Now I host all my courses on LifterLMS. TOTALLY different experience, because I'm free to do things MY way. I've never yet hit a wall where LifterLMS didn't enable me to do things the way I wanted.** Love it! Great support and community too."_

> _**Nick Usborne**, Teacher, Entrepreneur_

***

> _“**WP101.com serves more than 30,000 members**, so it’s no small challenge to migrate to a new membership plugin. **We spent more than a year carefully evaluating dozens of LMS and membership plugins before we finally discovered LifterLMS (a membership plugin and LMS plugin combined into one). It was the only plugin that checked all the boxes for our needs for course creation and membership functionality.** And the LifterLMS team also shares our passion for creating better online learning experiences. In particular, we deeply resonate with their goal of restoring the human touch to online learning—something that is absent from most online courses today.”_

> _**Shawn Hesketh**, Owner, WP101_

***

> _"As a former School Teacher, professional User Experience Designer, and current online course creator – I can honestly attribute much of our success to LifterLMS and it’s consideration for multiple learning modalities, the LMS UI/UX out of the box, and natural student Engagement opportunities. **In less than 10 months we’ve gone from $0 to $300K in revenue with LifterLMS** playing a huge part in that!! I’m looking forward to everything that comes next from the creators of LifterLMS!!"_

> _**Sarah Lorenzen**, Teacher, Entrepreneur_

***

> _"LifterLMS has been **the best decision we have made** towards the build out of our course library, online Learning Management System site, and community. The breadth and depth of what LifterLMS offers in a few WordPress plugins exceeds anything else we evaluated as it includes: easy course construction, integrated eCommerce, community capabilities, gamification and the support for delivery of 1-on-1 coaching collaboration services. Lifter also has pre-built integrations with other key WordPress technologies we wanted to use. LifterLMS has attracted a solid community and support network of leading experts to help guide anyone who wants to transform the world or their industry with online training. **Chris and the Lifter team are real people, and they care**."_

> _**Michael Wolf**, CEO, emPowering NOW LLC (Golden XPR)_

***

> _"I bought/installed LifterLMS yesterday then spent the day having a blast! Two years ago I started writing a book, which morphed into wanting to present the material online in a more interactive way. I started my website from scratch in January and installing the WordPress LMS plugin was a milestone moment! A milestone moment that turned out to be one joy right after the other! I'm always amazed when something is made easy! The LifterLMS product is amazing!! Power to the people! **Really quite extraordinary to have something so helpful be able to be in the hands of regular folk**."_
